## Features
- Loads and parses movie data from a JSON file
- Displays movie information such as title, genre, and release year
- Supports searching, filtering, or sorting movies (if implemented)
- Simple and intuitive interface or console-based interaction

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to:
- Practice reading and working with JSON data
- Understand data modeling and structured data formats
- Strengthen programming fundamentals related to data processing

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the project in your IDE or code editor
3. Run the main program file or open `index.html` in a browser (if web-based)
4. Interact with the movie database using the provided interface or console output

## Notes
- This project was created for educational purposes
- The focus is on data handling and logic rather than advanced UI design
- Code structure reflects learning-focused implementation
